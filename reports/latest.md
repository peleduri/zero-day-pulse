## 3. 🟠 Zero-Day — Google Workspace’s continuous approach to mitigating indirect prompt injections

**CVE:** _No CVE_ &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Source:** Google Security Blog &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Published:** 2026-04-02
**Reference:** <http://security.googleblog.com/2026/04/google-workspaces-continuous-approach.html>

> Posted by Adam Gavish, Google GenAI Security Team Indirect prompt injection (IPI) is an evolving threat vector targeting users of complex AI applications with multiple data sources, such as Workspace with Gemini. This technique enables the attacker to influence the behavior of an LLM by injecting malicious instructions into the data or tools used by the LLM as it completes the user’s query. This m…

**Parallel AI Enrichment:**

- **Technical Details:** Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) is an attack technique that injects malicious instructions into data or tools used by an LLM (including agentic workflows) so the model is influenced while completing a user query — potentially without any direct user input. This is a content/flow manipulation of sources that LLMs consume rather than a traditional software bug.
- **Affected Products:** Google Workspace with Gemini (enterprise LLM features)
- **CVSS Score:** CVSS score unavailable.
- **CVSS Vector:** CVSS vector unavailable.
- **Exploit Available:** Exploit availability unknown.
- **Patch Available:** true — vendor published advisory/mitigations: http://security.googleblog.com/2026/04/google-workspaces-continuous-approach.html
- **Active Exploitation:** false
- **Threat Actors:** None known
- **Mitigation:** Use a defence-in-depth approach: harden models against IPI, apply input and content sanitization for external sources, restrict or carefully control agentic automation and tool use, use continuous monitoring and layered application-level protections; follow vendor guidance in the advisory for Workspace/Gemini integrations.

## 6. 🟠 Zero-Day — Mitigating prompt injection attacks with a layered defense strategy

**CVE:** _No CVE_ &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Source:** Google Security Blog &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Published:** 2025-06-13
**Reference:** <http://security.googleblog.com/2025/06/mitigating-prompt-injection-attacks.html>

> Posted by Adam Gavish, Google GenAI Security Team With the rapid adoption of generative AI, a new wave of threats is emerging across the industry with the aim of manipulating the AI systems themselves. One such emerging attack vector is indirect prompt injections. Unlike direct prompt injections, where an attacker directly inputs malicious commands into a prompt, indirect prompt injections involve…

**Parallel AI Enrichment:**

- **Technical Details:** Indirect prompt injection occurs when an LLM processes external content (e.g., emails, documents, calendar invites) that contains hidden malicious instructions, causing the model to execute unintended actions such as data exfiltration or command execution. Attackers embed these instructions in seemingly benign data sources, and the LLM, without proper sanitization, incorporates them into its prompt context.
- **Affected Products:** Google Gemini (Gemini 2.5 models), Google Workspace (Gmail, Docs, Calendar), Google AI services
- **CVSS Score:** CVSS score unavailable
- **CVSS Vector:** CVSS vector unavailable
- **Exploit Available:** Exploit availability unknown
- **Patch Available:** false
- **Active Exploitation:** false
- **Threat Actors:** None known
- **Mitigation:** Google employs a layered defense strategy that includes model hardening with adversarial training (Gemini 2.5), prompt injection content classifiers, security thought reinforcement, markdown sanitization, suspicious URL redaction, user confirmation frameworks, and end‑user security notifications. These controls are applied at each stage of the prompt lifecycle to detect and neutralize hidden malicious instructions.
